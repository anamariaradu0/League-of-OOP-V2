League of OOP, November 2019

My take on this game is as follows:

Seen as the Land does not have complex operations attributed to it, I chose not to define
special classes for it.

My heroes are generated using a hero factory. The interface IHero allows for double
dispatch, while the abstract class Hero is a starting point for all types of fighters.

Seen as my heroes can be both visitors and visitable instances, I chose to tweak my
double dispatch implementation: a hero can both accept and perform an action (here,
fighting). This made sense to me as each fight is closely tied to the hero's current
state and current opponent, so creating different classes for each type of fight would
have made the implementation harder and not as natural for me (and this is only my
opinion).

Seen as heroes are both visitors and visitable objects, all that I had to implement
in each hero's class was fighting with the 4 types of opponents, keeping in mind each
particular case and all of the bonuses.

The Grand Magician is implemented using an Observer Pattern and is designed to keep
track of everything that happens during the game: it receives updates on hero deaths,
hero evolution, angel spawns and so on.

Each player can pick a strategy (behaviour implemented using the Strategy Pattern),
based on their HP.

The angels act as visitors to the heroes and can be observed by the Grand Magician.
